-fix unit movement and attack after refactoring code
- fit code to work with gameUnit.CurrentState (instead of isDead etc.)


game phases:
	1. instead of destroying a game unit on death, disable it, add it to a list to return to bench at the end of round
	2. each unit notifies round manager when finished attacking, the board counts if no units left and then round is over
		
- show level

Game Mechanics:
- abilities- fireheart stun arrow
- traits logic - assassin invis backline
- opponent levels
- enable bench units drag on battle
- items - monsters item orb drops
- items shop
- armor and magic resist
- every unit must be an attacker and a mover. To create units that don't move or attack, change to interfaced based Iattacker, Imover

Animations & UI:
- on unit click, show unitinfo / start drag only when moving unit
- game phases: hide attack button on buttle, remove all from board on results, show title
- opponent/player units bench to hex animation
- unit hover
- shop unit hover
- menu
- separate UiManager code
- hide attack button on round start
